# Project Hexblade

Currently under the working title "Project Hexblade", this is a D&amp;D web-app
for use as a companion app for players to use at tables. D&amp;D can be a
complicated game to play sometimes, especially for newer players, and for
more advanced players, who like to tweak and change the systems to better
fit their ideas, this means adding their own variations to the rules, which can
make things even more confusing. Enter Project Hexblade, a modular, easy-to-use,
and easy-to-customize web-app. The idea is to have each "chunk" of the 
"character sheet" as a component, which can be easily modified or replaced by the user.
